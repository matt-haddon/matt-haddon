### Hi, I'm Matt! 👋

Full Stack Software Developer with 8 years experience in the finance industry.

Focused on Javascript technologies (React, React Native, Redux, Angular, Typescript, Node - Express & Koa, GraphQL, SQL and NoSQL databases).

In my spare time I love developing apps, learning new technologies, yoga, running and reading.

Looking to leverage my software skills and management/accounting experience to add value as a front end, mobile or full stack engineer.
